\chapter{Introduction}

This thesis is divided into 4 main chapters. Firstly I give a brief introduction, which is intended to give an overview of the two numerical experiments I made and places the experiments in a larger context so that previous work can later be compared to this work.
The second chapter is about machine learning as a tool, which is used for the two experiments.

\section{Thesis structure}
This thesis is divided into 4 main chapters. Firstly I give a brief introduction, which is intended to give an overview of the two numerical experiments I made.

The thesis is separated into two parts in which each includes an evaluation of a numerical experiment. Both experiments are based on methods from the field of machine learning, which are summarized in chapter 2.
